# Task: Online Shopping Cart System

Design and implement a simple Online Shopping Cart system in Java. This task should be completable in approximately 40 minutes and will focus on demonstrating your understanding of core Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Requirements:

1. Create the following classes:

- Product
- ShoppingCart
- Customer
- Order

2. Implement the following features:

- Add products to the shopping cart
- Remove products from the shopping cart
- Calculate the total price of items in the cart
- Apply a simple discount (e.g., 10% off if total is above $100)
- Create an order from the shopping cart

3. Demonstrate the following OOP concepts:

- Encapsulation: Use private fields and public methods appropriately
- Inheritance: Create at least one subclass (e.g., DiscountedProduct extends Product)
- Polymorphism: Use method overriding in the subclass
- Abstraction: Create at least one abstract class or interface

4. Utilize the following Java features:

- Collections: Use appropriate collection types (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap)
- Enums: Create an enum for product categories or order status
- Exception handling: Implement at least one custom exception
